# Induced-bias-experiment
induced bias experiment for deepnet paper

TODO:
<!-- - implement circular bbox -->
- implement spiral posterior
- produce rotational hellinger plots (hellinger vs euclidean; posterior vs euclidean), for in/outside of the circular bbox, to see which algo is more confident outside the range of the training data
