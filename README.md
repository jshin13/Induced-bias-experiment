- [x] remove KNN and XGBoost from the figure

12/08/20 <br>
- [x] generate circular bbox posterior/hellinger plots with extended range (0,3) 
- [x] remove SVC and rename nuSVC as SVM

12/05/20 <br>
- [x] produce radial posterior/hellinger plots (hellinger vs euclidean; posterior vs euclidean), for in/outside of the circular bbox, to see which algo is more confident outside the range of the training data
